## Overview

SwapJoys is a B2B platform that enables companies to exchange employee experiences and benefits. Companies can create experiences (dining, wellness, entertainment, etc.) and offer them to employees of other companies through a points-based exchange system.

### Key Concepts

- **Companies** register and manage their employees
- **Experiences** are created and published to a marketplace
- **Points** are used to book experiences from other companies
- **QR Codes** verify and redeem booked experiences
- **Tax Documentation** tracks welfare benefits for Norwegian tax compliance

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | React |
| **Backend** | Laravel (PHP) |
| **Database** | MySQL |
| **Authentication** | JWT with Laravel Sanctum |
| **Hosting** | VPS |

### Architecture Principles

- Horizontal Scaling — Stateless services
- Performance — < 2s QR verification, < 300ms API response
- Security — Encryption at rest/transit, RBAC, signed tokens
- Immutable Ledger — Append-only transaction logs
- GDPR Compliance — Data minimization, retention rules
